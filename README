This is a fork of the actual DAT210X github repo with notebooks of my own added.

SSH ISSUES
-----------

If you look at .git/config you will see that the repo URL is given
as git@yatinla rather than git@github.com.  This is an ssh alias
which is in ~/.ssh/config and causes ssh to use the public key in
yatinla.pub.  Otherwise it will use the id_rsa.pub key which is
already tied to the mt-jh-ml github account.
