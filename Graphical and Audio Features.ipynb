    "In addition to text and natural language processing, bag of words has successfully been applied to images by categorizing a collection of regions and describing only their appearance, but ignoring any spatial structure. However this is not the typical approach which is used, and requires you come up with methods of categorizing image regions. More frequently used methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Split the image into a grid of smaller areas, and attempt feature extraction at each locality. Then return a combined array of all discovered features\n",
    "2.  Use variable-length gradients and other transformations as the features, such as regions of high / low luminosity, histogram counts for horizontal and vertical black pixels, stroke and edge detection, etc.\n",
    "3.  Resize the picture to a fixed size, convert it to grayscale, then encode every pixel as an element in a unidimensional feature array\n",
